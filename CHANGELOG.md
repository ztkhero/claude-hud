# Changelog

All notable changes to Claude HUD will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Incremental transcript parsing: renders resume from the previous render's byte offset instead of re-reading the whole JSONL, taking a 95MB session's parse from ~174ms to ~1.8ms per render. Falls back to a full parse on truncation, rewound mtime, fingerprint mismatch, or any cache error; disabled below 1MB and via `CLAUDE_HUD_TRANSCRIPT_CACHE=0`.
- Prompt cache countdown (`⧗ 41m`) in the usage line, timed from when the last API request was sent. The 5-minute vs 1-hour cache window is detected from the transcript's `cache_creation` tiers. Configurable via `display.showCacheTimer` and `display.promptCacheTtlSeconds` (`auto` by default).

## [0.0.10] - 2026-03-14

### Added
- Semantic HUD color overrides for context and usage states.

### Changed
- Update the fallback autocompact buffer estimate from `22.5%` (`45k/200k`) to `16.5%` (`33k/200k`) to match current Claude Code `/context` output.
- Clarify in code comments that the fallback buffer is empirical and may change independently of documented Claude Code releases.
- Clarify that context percentages and token displays scale with Claude Code's reported context window size, including newer 1M-context sessions.
- Text-only usage display now shows the 7-day reset countdown when applicable.
- Rate-limited usage refreshes now keep the last successful values visible while marking the HUD as syncing.

### Fixed
- Context percentage no longer starts with an inflated fallback percentage before native data exists.
- Usage API rate-limit handling is more resilient, including better stale-cache behavior and `Retry-After` parsing.
- Zero-byte usage lock files now recover instead of leaving the HUD permanently busy.
- Plugin selection now prefers the highest installed version instead of filesystem mtime.
- macOS Keychain lookup now prefers account-scoped credentials and avoids cross-account fallback when multiple accounts exist.

## [0.0.9] - 2026-03-05

### Changed
- Add Usage API timeout override via `CLAUDE_HUD_USAGE_TIMEOUT_MS` (default now 15s).

### Fixed
- Setup instructions now generate shell-safe Windows commands for `win32 + bash` environments (#121, #148).
- Bedrock startup model labels now normalize known model IDs when `model.display_name` is missing (#137).
- Usage API reliability improvements for proxy and OAuth token-refresh edge cases:
  - Respect `HTTPS_PROXY`/`ALL_PROXY`/`HTTP_PROXY` with `NO_PROXY` bypass.
  - Preserve usage and plan display when keychain tokens refresh without `subscriptionType` metadata.
  - Reduce false `timeout`/`403` usage warnings in proxied and high-latency environments (#146, #161, #162).
- Render output now preserves regular spaces instead of non-breaking spaces to avoid vertical statusline rendering issues on startup (#142).

---

## [0.0.8] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- Session name display in the statusline (#155).
- `display.contextValue: "remaining"` mode to show remaining context percent (#157).
- Regression tests for `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` path handling, keychain service resolution fallback ordering, and config counter overlap edge cases.

### Changed
- Prefer subscription plan labels over API env-var detection for account type display (#158).
- Usage reset time formatting now switches to days when the reset window is 24h or more (#132).

### Fixed
- Respect `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` for HUD config lookup, usage cache, speed cache, and legacy credentials file paths (#126).
- Improve macOS Keychain credential lookup for multi-profile setups by using profile-specific service names with compatibility fallbacks.
- Fix config counting overlap detection so project `.claude` files are still counted when `cwd` is home and user scope is redirected.
- Prevent HUD rows from disappearing in narrow terminals (#159).
- Handle object-based legacy layout values safely during config migration (#144).
- Prevent double-counting user vs project `CLAUDE.md` when `cwd` is home (#141).

### Dependencies
- Bump `@types/node` from `25.2.3` to `25.3.3` (#153).
- Bump `c8` from `10.1.3` to `11.0.0` (#154).

## [0.0.7] - 2026-02-06

### Changed
- **Redesigned default layout** — clean 2-line display replaces the previous multi-line default
  - Line 1: `[Opus | Max] │ my-project git:(main*)`
  - Line 2: `Context █████░░░░░ 45% │ Usage ██░░░░░░░░ 25% (1h 30m / 5h)`
- Model bracket moved to project line (line 1)
- Context and usage bars combined onto a single line with `│` separator
- Shortened labels: "Context Window" → "Context", "Usage Limits" → "Usage"
- Consistent `dim()` styling on both labels
- All optional features hidden by default: tools, agents, todos, duration, config counts
- Bedrock provider detection (#111)
- Output speed display (#110)
- Token context display option (#108)
- Seven-day usage threshold config (#107)

### Added
- Setup onboarding now offers optional features (tools, agents & todos, session info) before finishing
- `display.showSpeed` config option for output token speed

### Fixed
- Show API failure reason in usage display (#109)
- Support task todo updates in transcript parsing (#106)
- Keep HUD to one line in compact mode (#105)
- Use Platform context instead of uname for setup detection (#95)

---

## [0.0.6] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **Expanded multi-line layout mode** - splits the overloaded session line into semantic lines (#76)
  - Identity line: model, plan, context bar, duration
  - Project line: path, git status
  - Environment line: config counts (CLAUDE.md, rules, MCPs, hooks)
  - Usage line: rate limits with reset times
- New config options:
  - `lineLayout`: `'compact'` | `'expanded'` (default: `'expanded'` for new users)
  - `showSeparators`: boolean (orthogonal to layout)
  - `display.usageThreshold`: show usage line only when >= N%
  - `display.environmentThreshold`: show env line only when counts >= N

### Changed
- Default layout is now `expanded` for new installations
- Threshold logic uses `max(5h, 7d)` to ensure high 7-day usage isn't hidden

### Fixed
- Ghost installation detection and cleanup in setup command (#75)

### Migration
- Existing configs with `layout: "default"` automatically migrate to `lineLayout: "compact"`
- Existing configs with `layout: "separators"` migrate to `lineLayout: "compact"` + `showSeparators: true`

---

## [0.0.5] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Native context percentage support for Claude Code v2.1.6+
  - Uses `used_percentage` field from stdin when available (accurate, matches `/context`)
  - Automatic fallback to manual calculation for older versions
  - Handles edge cases: NaN, negative values, values >100
- `display.autocompactBuffer` config option (`'enabled'` | `'disabled'`, default: `'enabled'`)
  - `'enabled'`: Shows buffered % (matches `/context` when autocompact ON) - **default**
  - `'disabled'`: Shows raw % (matches `/context` when autocompact OFF)
- EXDEV cross-device error detection for Linux plugin installation (#53)

### Changed
- Context percentage now uses percentage-based buffer (22.5%) instead of hardcoded 45k tokens (#55)
  - Scales correctly for enterprise context windows (>200k)
- Remove automatic PR review workflow (#67)

### Fixed
- Git status: move `--no-optional-locks` to correct position as global git option (#65)
- Prevent stale `index.lock` files during git operations (#63)
- Exclude disabled MCP servers from count (#47)
- Reconvert Date objects when reading from usage API cache (#45)

### Credits
- Ideas from [#30](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/claude-hud/pull/30) ([@r-firpo](https://github.com/r-firpo)), [#43](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/claude-hud/pull/43) ([@yansircc](https://github.com/yansircc)), [#49](https://github.com/jarrodwatts/claude-hud/pull/49) ([@StephenJoshii](https://github.com/StephenJoshii)) informed the autocompact solution

### Dependencies

- Git status with dirty indicator and ahead/behind counts
- Configurable path levels (1-3 directory segments)
- Layout options: default and separators

### Added
- Display git branch name in session line (#23)
- Display project folder name in session line (#18)

### Changed
- Remove redundant COMPACT warning at high context usage (#27)
